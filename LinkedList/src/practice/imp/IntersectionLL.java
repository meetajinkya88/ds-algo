 *  
Write a function to get the intersection point of two Linked Lists.

There are two singly linked lists in a system. By some programming error, the end node of one of the linked list got linked to the second list, forming an inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked list merge.

		//	2) Get count of the nodes in the second list, let count be c2.
		//	3) Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
		//	4) Now traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes so that from here onwards 
		//       both the lists have equal no of nodes.
		//	5) Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node. 
		//       (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)
//		Time Complexity: O(m+n)
//		Auxiliary Space: O(1)

		// Alternate method (Make circle in first list)
//		1. Traverse the first linked list(count the elements) and make a circular linked list. 
//		(Remember the last node so that we can break the circle later on).
//		2. Now view the problem as finding the loop in the second linked list. So the problem is solved.
//		3. Since we already know the length of the loop(size of the first linked list) 
//		we can traverse those many numbers of nodes in the second list, and then start another 
//		pointer from the beginning of the second list. we have to traverse until they are equal, 
//		and that is the required intersection point.
//		4. remove the circle from the linked list.
//
//		Time Complexity: O(m+n)
//		Auxiliary Space: O(1)
